# Docker CircleCI Upgraded NPM Images

CircleCI provides convenience images for a variety of Node versions: https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/node

However, the NPM version in some of the images may not match the version that you would like.

This project contains a set of Dockerfiles that are based on the convenience images, but with the NPM version upgraded to specific versions.
